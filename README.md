# Password-generator
Test
## Description
Welcome!
Here you will find a password generator that will indeed generate a password for you, by following window displayed prompts. 

You will be prompted to select the total amount of characters you would like to be included in your password. 
Followed by a choice of different characters you can choose from.
If you simply do not desire a type of character in your password click cancel and it will not be generated inside your password. 
At the end of the pop ups you will recieve your own generated password.
Tadaaaa, now you have a brand new password!


Challenges:
Some of my challenges throughout this project were understanding how to structure my function in order for it to work properly. A big learn for me, through this challenge was that I could not write by "IF" statements after by confirm pop ups because it would stop my whole function.

Hopes: I hope to create smaller projects like this, that will allow for me to expand on my Javascript knowledge.

## Usage 
Here you can view a screenshot of the generator, if you click on the red button labeled "generate password" a window will display with prompts. 
Use it to generate a new password or to learn how to use display windows in any webpage.
